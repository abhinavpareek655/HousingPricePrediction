# Predecting Home Prices:
Data set used: Ames Housing Dataset</br>
Machine Learning algorithm: linear regression</br>
Aim: To predict prices using methodologies including REGRESSION ANALYSIS in Excel and machine learning modeling in RAPIDMINER.</br>

Data set discription: The Ames Housing Dataset encompasses extensive details on residential properties in
 Ames, Iowa. It includes numeric features like square footage, bedrooms, and
 construction year, alongside categorical features such as neighborhood and exterior
 material. The primary variable of interest is the property sale price.</br>

<p>Data Processing:</br>
 Handling Missing Values: Imputation methods were applied where numeric
 features were imputed with the mean and categorical features with the mode. If
 there are any missing values, please fill in with the average.</br>
 Feature Engineering: You may choose to perform feature engineering as
 discussed in class and create new variables (garage, street, utilities).
 We will preprocess some of the file together in class.</br>
 DummyVariables: Categorical variables were converted into numerical formats</p>
